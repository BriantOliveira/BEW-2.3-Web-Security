## üìñ Overview

### Questions to the class

1. What do you _currently_ know about web security?
1. What do you _want_ to know about web security?
1. What do you think is the biggest problem with web security today?

Think, pair, and share with these questions!

## üíª Activity: Historical Hacks Research

Form groups of four, and research one of the following historical hacks (each group will be assigned a hack):

- Equifax Exploit
- Anthem Medical Data Breach
- Mongo Lock
- Stuxnet
- WhatsApp Spyware Installation

Present the following to the class after you research:

- What happened during the hack?
- What type of attack was it?
- How was the attack managed? 

## üå¥ BREAK

## Secuurity Models

A model gives you a guide to create policies and systems that adhere to fundamental ideas and best practices.  

AAA and CIA are two models of web security that guide policies 
within an organization.

### CIA

**Confidentiality**

Who can see your data. Rules that limit the access to information. 

**Question:** What are some of the problems associated with confidentiality?

- Access restricted to those authorized to view data
- Policies for how data is stored
- Goal: protect data from unauthorized access and misuse. 
- "is the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes." 

**Integrity**
Who can edit or change your data. Maintaining consistency and trustworthiness of data.

**Question:** What are some of the feature of data integrity? 

- Data can not be modified or destroyed. 
- Ensure accuracy and authenticity
- Goal: Data can not be modified through accidental or intentional unauthorized actions.
data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner

**Availability**
Who and where your data can be accessed. Timely and reliable access to data

**Question:** Why is Availability important? 

- Data is available to authorized users.
- Data is available when needed.

### AAA

**Authentication**
Requires proof: Knowledge, hardware, biometric.

**Question:** Why is authentication important? 

- Identify users!

Examples: multifactor authentication, Two Factor Authentication

- Are there any problem with two factor authentication?

**Authorization**
Users can only perform tasks they are authorized for. 

**Question:** Why is authorization important? 

- Determines which actions and resources a user has access to


**Accounting**
Measures the resources a user consumes during access. 

**Question:** Why is accounting important?

- Knowing who accessed what, when is important

## Activity: Defining Vocabulary

In groups of four, research one of the following terms (each group will be assigned a term):

1. Actors
1. White Hat
1. Gray Hat
1. Black Hat
1. Ethical Hacking

Now mix up the groups so that each group has one member who is knoweldgable on each of the five terms, and present them to each other!
